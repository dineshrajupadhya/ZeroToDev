Explaintation:
This is a simple C program that prints a right-angled triangle star pattern based on the number of rows entered by the user.

How it works:

The program asks the user to enter a number (example: 5).

Using nested loops:

The outer loop (i) controls the number of rows.

The inner loop (j) controls how many stars (*) are printed in each row.

On each new line, the number of stars increases by one, forming a triangle shape.
